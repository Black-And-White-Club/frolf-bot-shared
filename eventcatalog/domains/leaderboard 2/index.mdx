## Overview

The **Leaderboard** domain is a bounded context within the Frolf Bot system that encapsulates all business logic related to leaderboard.

## Architecture

<NodeGraph />

## Event Patterns

All events in this domain follow:
- **Event Notification Pattern** (Martin Fowler) - Events contain complete data snapshots
- **V1 Versioning** - Topic names include `.v1` suffix for version compatibility

## Services

Both the backend service (frolf-bot) and Discord bot (discord-frolf-bot) participate in this domain's workflows.
